    <h1>Avin</h1>

    <p>For the last 8 years, I was the Head of New Products and Front-end at BizCommerce. A Saas e-commerce platform, co-founded by me, with focus on simplifying and customizing the use of Magento.</p>
    <p>Throughout these years I worked on (in addition to our entire visual identity) more than 200 tools, modules, APIs, hundreds of themes, and customized projects for our clients.</p>
    <p>Before this period for over 4 years, I switched between freelancing and starting my first company. I was designing and building personal websites, online magazines, news portals, blogs, web applications.</p>
    <p>Before designing for web, I was creating 3D models, matte painting, advertisements and arts for all types of brands. From exporters of cachaça to pepper sauce manufacturers, from pharmaceutical laboratories to toothpaste industries.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I was studying Philosophy, Japanese animation, 3D modeling and rendering, fine arts and video games. All of these subjects have a major impact on how I started and developed my creative process and somehow led the way on how I view web development today.</p>

    <p>Thanks for checking my website! It's a work in progress so check back often!</p>
    <p>I am available for new projects and a coffee, contact me at:</p>
